# Pac-Man

#### **IDEA** ####

For my final project, I would like to design the game Pac-Man. 
I have pretty standard background knowledge for this project, as 
it will be completed in C++, a programming language I've grown 
familiar with throughout the course of this semester. I want to do 
this project because I enjoy creating games; I like how they are 
very interactive and incorporate lots of design elements related to
animations, images, and sounds. This will keep me motivated in 
completing this project. 


#### **EXTERNAL LIBRARIES:** ####

A specific external library that I plan to use is Choreograph. This
external library will allow me to create animations for elements of 
Pac-Man rather than just having still 2-D images move across the screen.
For example, I will be able to animate Pac-Man, the ghosts, the food, etc.
I have also checked that this external library is compatible with
my operating system/IDE.

*Edit: I did not end up using Choreograph because I could not figure out how 
to use it. Instead, I decided to use SQLite3 and SQLite Modern Cpp as my external 
library, and I used it to create my leaderboard.

#### **ROUGH TIMELINE** ####

##### **WEEK ONE:** #####
* Create a single level. All elements should work properly (Pac-Man,
ghosts, food, fruit, point system, etc.)

##### **WEEK TWO:** #####
* Create a home page that allows user to start a game or view
high scores. 

* Create a high score page that displays top scores.

##### **WEEK THREE:** #####
* Extend the game play so that the player keeps playing levels
until they lose all their lives rather than simply completing
one level. 

#### **STRETCH GOALS** ####
If I complete this project early, a stretch goal I could implement would
be creating multiple difficulties or settings. For example, I could create
an 'easy' mode that gives the user more lives and has 2 ghosts instead of 4. 
I could also create a 'difficult' mode that gives the user less lives and 
more ghosts. I would allow the user to choose the difficulty at the start
of the game.
