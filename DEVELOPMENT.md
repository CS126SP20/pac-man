# Development

- **4/20/20** 
    - Linked CinderBlock Choreograph to my project

- **4/21/20**
    - Created Engine, PacMan, Map, Direction, and Location classes
    - Imported gflags for use
    - Added logic: PacMan moves across the screen and map UI displays correctly;
    however, logic for collisions and movement restriction has not been added yet
    
- **4/22/20**
    - Added logic: PacMan now moves with constraints; can only move
    within the walls of the maze
    - Added a Ghost class and implemented images for each ghost
    
- **4/23/20**
    - Added UI for food; however, it has no other functions as of now and
    Pac-Man cannot interact with it
    
- **4/26/20**
    - Fixed bug that was causing the ghost to move L/R/U/D instead of U/D/L/R
    - Added some logic that allows 1 ghost to move on its own; however, still
    quite buggy so I need to smooth things out still
